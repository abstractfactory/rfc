# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System](http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/COSS) (COSS).

# Goal

To establish that Frameworks, Methods and Processes are the only three categories fit for any problem faced in the creation of Content.

# Definition

1. A framework provides guidelines. It exists to provide structure and direction on a preferred way of doing something without being too detailed or rigid. Programming languages are analagous to frameworks.

2. A method is a body of techniques; a limited and further distilled Framework which typically serve to solve specific problems. Applications are analagous to methods.

3. A process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end. It is the lowest-level of performing a task and may be broken down into two or more processes; this is known as [Divide and Conquer][]
