# Goal

The definition of "metadata" has been continually re-invented over the years. Re-invented to fit a particular use. Traditionally, content and metadata was kept separate. Traditionally, methods of persisting and manipulating metadata was ad-hoc.

Not any more.

Open Metadata is designed to make content self-describing. Intelligent, capable of persisting associated metadata; complex, homogeneous

The number of uses for "data about data" are as many as "data" itself. It is our hope that together with this document you shall gain perspective on some of the possible problems this solution solves and how it can aid in bringing together a multitude of ad-hoc solutions for general purpuse metadata, software configuration, persistent/memoized storage of software settings and more.
