### Goal

To establish that Frameworks, Methods and Processes are the only three categories fit for any problem faced in the creation of Content.

### Definition

1. A framework provides guidelines. It exists to provide structure and direction on a preferred way of doing something without being too detailed or rigid. Programming languages are analagous to frameworks.

2. A method is a body of techniques; a limited and further distilled Framework which typically serve to solve specific problems. Applications are analagous to methods.

3. A process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end. Your understanding of a process lie at the heart of your ability to automate it.
